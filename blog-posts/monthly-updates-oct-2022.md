Hey Requestlian 👋,

This is Sachin - Founder & CEO, <a href="https://bit.ly/rq-chrome" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><u>Requestly.</u></a> In this newsletter, I bring the latest Requestly developments in the month of Oct'22. If you are from a SaaS Company and your Javascript tag is installed on external websites, you might want to test your changes directly on the live customer website but if your customers have content-security-policy enabled then browser won't load your tag. But here's a good news you can use Requestly to bypass content-security-policy.

Here's a quick tutorial to understand content-security-policy and how you can bypass it using Requestly Modify Headers Rule 🔥

<h2>Loading local JS files in live/production sites (Map Local) ⚡️ </h2>

We recently published <a href="https://requestly.io/blog/how-to-load-local-js-files-on-live-production-sites/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><u>an article</u></a>(& a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85GVaOWTnlE" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><u>youtube video</u></a>) that helps you learn how you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85GVaOWTnlE" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><u>load your local javascript files in live/production sites.</u></a> 

This technique is very helpful for web developers to:
* Test local changes directly in production env and saves deployment time
* Debug issues directly on production env (No need to setup the entire thing & reproduce issues)

Have a quick look at the video and Unlock your productivity:

<h2>Free & Open-Source debugger for Android debug builds🚀 </h2><br>

We completed development & testing for our <a href="https://github.com/requestly/requestly-android-sdk" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><u>Android debugger.</u></a> Requestly Android debugger provides Chrome-like developer tool for Android debug builds.
* Network Inspector (All APIs, requests, responses, etc)
* Analytics Events Inspector (Debug analytics events directly on Android device)
* Host Switcher (Connect your Android app to dev/staging/prod environment)

<h2>Customer of the Month 🤝🏻</h2> <br>

<a href="https://15gifts.com/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><u>15Gifts</u></a> integrates recommendation technology into third party sites through their JS tag that helps customers find their ideal product quickly.

* 15gifts frontend & QA team migrated from Charles Proxy to Requestly after finding out how easy it is to test JS tags on external websites using Requestly.
* 15gifts uses Requestly Insert Script feature to easily run their code on a client's website to test an early cart integration which helps them in exploring and solving any potential issues upfront thereby saving cost of communication/reporting by the customer.
* 15gifts uses SharedList feature to share the rules that work and saves the hassle of other people having to set up their own rules or debug someone else’s configuration.
